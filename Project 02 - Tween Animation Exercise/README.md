# Android Tween Animation Sample
I tried to create a mixed animation by using all features of tween animation in this project.

These features were applied on an imageView. 

The animations on the imageView continue in the following order.

- The animation of imageView starts by moving on the x-axis. 
- It moves on y-axis.
- When the imageView comes back to first place, the alpha value of imageView decreases.
- The dimensions of the imageView increase. 
- The imageView rotates around itself.
- The alpha value turns into its old value.

Here is the animation video
